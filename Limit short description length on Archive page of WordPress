In order to limit the short description's length on your archive page of WordPress, 
which usually don't provide any ability to limit the length unless hiding them.
you might be thinking to choose plugin but to increase your website speed and optimization, prefer manual way.
You just need to start following the given steps.

Step 1: Select the short description's class from inspect elements.
Step 2: you just have to open your custom css section throught customization.
Step 3: write code inside your class bracket:

.ast-woo-shop-product-description {
display: -webkit-box;
-webkit-box-orient: vertical;
-webkit-line-clamp: 3;
overflow: hidden;
height: 90px
}Â ;

These five lines will save your life.
-webkit-line-clamp: 3 define the text will occupy 3 lines total and overflow: hidden is very important part,
 as it wont allow the other lines to overlap on these three lines. Just to save you life, assign height to the class as it will not make design look bizarre.
